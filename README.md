# External-Projects
---
Welcome to my repository in which I host various projects which I have deemed "external". There are many projects which are more practice-oriented for me, and are less full-fledged modular programs. Many of these are smaller projects; but are ones which highlight my interests as I program. This excludes my larger projects which are hosted on alternative repositories, and just the ones that I believe are interesting, but not original enough to be anything else. 

I have attached to many of these *.org* files which basically **embed** code into the file and also give beautiful documentation (if you choose to download as a pdf). This is a repository which will be updating very often, and hopefully you find something of interest. 

For any **Emacs** users, I have used the **Org-Babel** plugin in order to *tangle* my code inside of my document. If you are a DOOM Emacs user, simply download the file into your org repo and press **Enter** in order to run the codeblock which will return itself in a drawer titled *:Properties:*. 

If you are not a DOOM user, run whichever keybinding is necessary to run the command "Org Babel Execute" and then you should see the results in the same manner.
